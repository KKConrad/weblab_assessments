            <p class="color bold border"> Press the Y Button if you want to use a special technique, then select the
                Special Technique you want to use and press the Y Button. Now, select the
                enemies or party members you want to use it on, then press the Y Button again
                to start using the special techniques.If you want to cause more damage, or get
                extra effects, see the Special Techniques in the BATTLE PARTY section. </p>

            <p class="italics bold">
                Press the X Button if you want to use an item, then select the item you want to
                use and press the X Button. Then select the enemies or party members you want
                to use it on, then press X again to use the item. If you press the X Button at
                the right time when the item is being used you will get a "Freebie", it seems
                you can only do this once for every item, but this trick is still useful for
                rare one-time use items such as Rock Candy and Red Essence.

            <p class="margin color">It's a Mario! The worlds most famous stereotype hmmm.. maybe that's not so
                true. If he was a common Italian-American stereotype he would live in New
                Jersey and Bowser would be sleeping with the fishes by now. Anyhow, he is the
                only character that has to be permanently in your team, so luckily he is one of
                the best characters in the game. He has brutal physical attacks and fairly
                strong special techniques; which are his trademark Fireball and Jump attacks.
            </p>
            <p class="margin border">
                Mallow the frog err... marshmallow. French restaurants would be more popular
                if the frogs they used looked and tasted like him. But anyway, this poor little
                chap joins Mario's party (permanently) because he finds out he's adopted and
                wants to search for his real parents! (wouldn't his parents be confectionary
                machines). Anyhow, this little piece of fluff has devastating lightning based
                attacks. He also has the very useful "Psychopath", which shows how much HP the
                enemy has and what it's thinking (if your timing's right). He also can be used
                as a healer, since he learns "HP Rain" fairly early.
            </p>
            <p class="size border italics">
                As soon as you enter the Forest Maze jump in the bottom left corner to uncover
                a Surprise Box with a Kerokero Cola. There are lots of Mushroom around here but
                pick them with caution as they could be an enemy called Amanita disguised.
                Go left to the next section, there is a constant march of Wigglers coming from
                the hollow in a stump, every time you jump on a Wiggler you'll get a Coin but
                if you jump on a single Wiggler 10 times you'll get a Frog Coin. Go down the
                stump (like a pipe) and make your way through the cave while watching out for
                Amanita and jump on the trampoline at the end. As soon as you emerge from the
                tree hollow walk left (NW) and jump to hit a Surprise Box with a Frog Coin
                inside.  Now go up and left to the next section.
